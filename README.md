## Project Goals and Expectations

- Client wants the site to serve as a catalogue of his inventory for his customers to view. 
- Client wants to recieve less calls and hopes the website will allow customers to help themselves.
- Target audience of the site is his existing customers, many of which are young and so the site should be developed mobile-first.
- The site should be responsive so it will work across all kinds of devices.
- Code must be suitably documented
- Client does not want the website to involve any external subscriptions or services.
